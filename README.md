# Overabundant Alpine Lakes in Washington

My wife and I are big hikers, and one of our favorite things to do up in the mountains is fish in the pristine lakes.

Some of the lakes have been overstocked, leading to an undue burden on the lake ecosystem
and small fish because they can't get enough food.
The WDFW maintains a <a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/locations/high-lakes/overabundant">list</a>
of such lakes, and they encourage anglers to fish in them.

Unfortunately the (long) list on their website is just unstructured text - not helpful for planning a fishing trip.
This repo creates a <a href="https://field-cady.github.io/overabundant_lakes/">site</a>
that puts all the overstocked lakes on an interactive map so you can see where they are and easily plan your trip.

It is used and appreciated by anglers across the state, who want to do a public service while
also enjoying their favorite outdoor passtime.
